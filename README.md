# Coulette

The goal of this exercise is to create a <a href="https://coulette.netlify.app/">Coulette app</a> to randomly generate colors.

The functionality of this app will be achieved at a later point, using JavaScript.
For now, I have used the opportunity to prepare the layout to review some <b>HTML, CSS and Git</b> basics
